        <p>Greetings adventures! We are ROAD DOGS and we have created this application for all those who love to play
        dungeons and dragons in their own way. We allow for lots of customization for our characters and game masters.

        a game master you will have access to our campaign features which allow for collecting players and having notes 
        for your campaign as well as have your own characters! Are you ready to begin your adventure? </p>
