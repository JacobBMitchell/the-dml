        <h1>Welcome to the DUNGEON MASTER'S LAIR</h1>
        <p>Greetings adventures! We are ROAD DOGS  and we have created a dungeons and dragons app that helps join players and
        game masters in an easy and customizable environment. We allow our game masters access to character sheets from their 
        campaigns to create better stories from the properties of the characters. As a game master myself I've had to hassle
        around collecting and copying character sheets to get a feel for my player's characters, now we've molded it into one place.
        As well as we've allowed for more customizable characters to allow for more homebrew and creativity at the table.
        Our website is easy to use and contains tools and resources to make dungeons and dragons easy and exciting to play! </p>
